## In this repository, I have included C++ programming projects.


### Project Description. 


This project focuses on backend programming the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It incorporates user authentication, banking operations, transaction history tracking, and data persistence, providing a real-world simulation of ATM processes. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project: 


- Project Name: **HIGH-FUNCTION ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING C++.**
- User Authentication: Secure login system where users must enter a valid ID and password. Credentials are validated against stored data to ensure only authorized access to individual accounts.
- Banking Operations: Provides users with essential banking functionalities, including checking account balances, depositing funds, and withdrawing money. Withdrawal operations are subject to predefined limits to prevent excessive withdrawals.
- Transaction History: Each banking transaction (deposit or withdrawal) is recorded with a timestamp. Users can view their transaction history at any time to track account activity and monitor their financial operations.
- Data Persistence: Ensures that user data, including account details and transaction histories, are saved in text files. This allows for data retention across multiple sessions, ensuring users can access their data even after exiting the program.
- File Handling: Utilizes efficient file handling techniques to read and write user account information and transaction records. The program ensures data integrity by accurately saving and retrieving user data from external files.
- Security Features: Includes several security measures, such as maximum withdrawal limits and checks for sufficient account balance during transactions, ensuring that users cannot withdraw more than allowed or beyond their available funds.
- Error Handling: The program validates all user inputs to prevent invalid operations, such as entering negative values for deposits or withdrawals. Users are prompted to correct any errors, ensuring smooth and reliable program operation.
- Scalability: Designed to support multiple users, the system allows the addition of new accounts by simply updating the user data file. Future features can be easily added, such as loan processing or account management.
- Code Modularity: The project is built with modularity in mind, using clearly defined functions to handle different tasks, such as authentication, transactions, and file operations. This makes the code easier to manage, maintain, and extend.
- Learning Experience: This project provides hands-on experience with C++ concepts such as file handling, loops, conditionals, and functions. It serves as a real-world example of backend system design and programming, especially for banking operations.
